# cover

Using the "Set Cover Problem" as a context to play with Go.

The initial plan is to mix some algorithms to build a solver for
weighted covering problems with strictly positive costs. I haven't
decided if the focus will be on general covers or exact covers (also known
as the "set partitioning problem").
