# cover

Using the "Set Cover Problem" as a context to play with Go.

The initial plan is to mix some algorithms to build a solver for
weighted covering problems with strictly positive costs. I haven't
decided if the focus will be on general covers or exact covers (also known
as the "set partitioning problem").

# Project Note

As of August 2023, I have focused little on Go and thus I am unsure of the
point of this project since then. The primary reason for this project was to
become better at Go for a project at work. But that project has been paused
and my focus returned a Java code base.
